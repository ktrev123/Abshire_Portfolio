## Trevor Dean Abshire, M.S., CSCS, CPSS

TEST2 My name is Trevor Abshire, I am an ex-collegiate starting pitcher, currently serving as Assistant Director of Sport Performance and Lead Data Analyst at the University of California Davis. With a strong passion for leveraging data to drive performance and optimize training strategies, I strive to blend my background in athletics with my analytical skills to deliver impactful insights.

As an ex-collegiate athlete, I understand the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving athletic performance. My experience on the field, in the weight room, and in the lab have ignited a keen interest in exploring the vast potential of data analytics within the sports industry. Combining my expertise in strength and conditioning with my proficiency in data analytics, I aim to optimize training protocols, identify performance patterns, and provide valuable insights to athletes and coaches to increase longevity and win championships!

During my comprehensive biomechanics experience, I had the opportunity to delve into various domains, including pitching, powerlifting, gait analysis, jumping, and isolated joint kinematics. I have hands on experience with calibrating and capturing kinematic data from motion capture systems. I also have collected, cleaned, and analyzed various performance data to contribute to research and my own projects and professional endeavors. I was even a subject in a competitive deadlift case study!

Throughout my career, I have successfully applied data analytics techniques to analyze and interpret complex datasets, enabling evidence-based decision-making. I possess a strong foundation in various analytical tools and programming languages, including R, SQL, Excel/Sheets, and Tableau, allowing me to extract actionable insights from diverse datasets and communicate them effectively to stakeholders. I am currently taking a Python course from the University of Michigan which I am enjoying very much. 


In this portfolio, I showcase some of my projects, skills, and qualifications, demonstrating my ability to extract valuable insights from data and drive positive outcomes. I am excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and contribute to the field of data analytics in the context of sports and performance optimization.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out for potential collaboration, discussion, or networking opportunities.

 <summary>Project 1: KinaTrax Pitching Data - Case Study</summary>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Analyze and interpret biomechanical and ball pitching data for performance and injury preventative purposes (Averages, Launch Angles, Spin Rates, Elbow Varus Torque).</li>
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> Pitching-related elbow injuries are commonly observed across various levels of baseball and are often attributed to the repetitive high-velocity throws, placing stress on structures such as the ulnar collateral ligament and radiohumeral articulation (Ciccotti et al., 2017; Melugin, Leafblad, Camp, & Conte, 2018; Saper et al., 2018; Anz et al., 2010; Chalmers et al., 2017). Early trunk rotation during the pitching delivery has shown to increase torques at the shoulder and elbow. However, the specific mechanisms of energy transmitting through the kinetic chain and into the medial elbow remain unclear. Understanding these mechanisms can provide useful information into optimizing pitching techniques and minimizing the risk of elbow injuries (Aguinaldo, Buttermore, & Chambers, 2007; Oyama et al., 2014; Aguinaldo & Chambers, 2009; Werner et al., 2002).</li>

      What pitch type (Pitch_Type) was thrown to the batter on each hit?<br>
      What was the launch angle (Launch_Angle) on each hit?<br>
      What was the result of each play (Play_Result)?<br>
      Bullet-point up to 3 primary insights you can derive from this ranking.<br>
      <img src="https://github.com/ktrev123/Trevor-Abshire-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Exit_Velo.png" alt="image" width="600">
      <ul>
        <li>11 out of 15 (73%) of the hardest hit pitches were fastballs, suggesting that weaker contact could be influenced with off-speed pitches</li>
        <li>Launch angles between 10 and 26 degrees often presented desirable play results (Single/HomeRun) while launch angles greater than 30 resulted in outs</li>
        <li>If a hitter can achieve high exit velocities (>100mph), coaches might consider implementing practice drills where hitters are encouraged to attack the ball within 10 to 26 degrees of launch angle</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Is there a statistically significant difference in mean Elbow Varus Torque at Max Shoulder External Rotation (Elb_Var_Torque_MER) between Pitchers (id_pitcher) 800021 and 800098? (Î± _< 0.05)<br>

  <summary>Project 3: Asymmetry Assessment and Flagging</summary>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a comprehensive assessment framework to evaluate asymmetries in the single leg jump test, considering peak landing force, and flag individuals at higher risk of injury, while providing strength and conditioning coaches a named list recommending potential exercise interventions for any athlete with a greater than 15% asymmetry in landing forces.</li>
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are devastating injuries in professional athletes, affecting approximately 4% of players each year. Deceleration was found to be the most common injury maneuver, observed in 32 (60%) athletes. Defensive backs and wide receivers sustained the most injuries, with 14 (26%) and 12 (23%) cases, respectively. Out of all injuries, 44 (83%) were first-time ACL injuries, while nine (17%) had a history of previous ACL injury (Schick et al., 2023). Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the greatest strain is placed on the ACL, relative to other knee ligaments, at low angles of knee flexion, typically around 15Â° (Schick et al., 2023; Johnson et al., 2019). As the degree of knee flexion increases, the ACL is off-loaded, and greater stress is placed on other knee ligaments (Schick et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2018).</li>
