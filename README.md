<h3>Project 3: Asymmetry Assessment and Flagging üèà</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a comprehensive assessment framework to evaluate asymmetries in the single leg jump test, considering peak landing force, and flag individuals at higher risk of injury, while providing strength and conditioning coaches a named list recommending potential exercise interventions for any athlete with a greater than 15% asymmetry in landing forces </li>
      <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Identifying athletes with significant peak force asymmetries and implementing quality-specific plyometric/strength exercises (drop jumps, single leg jumps, etc.) </li>
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> ACL tears are significant injuries in professional athletes, affecting about 4% annually, with deceleration being the most common injury maneuver observed in approximately 60% of cases. Defensive backs and wide receivers are the most affected, and biomechanical studies indicate that the ACL experiences the highest strain at low knee flexion angles, around 15¬∞, while other knee ligaments bear greater stress as knee flexion increases. (Schick et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2018).</li>

<h3>Project 4: Vertical Jump, Relative Concentric Peak Force, Bodyweight Visualization üèà</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Visualize the comparison between vertical jump combine data, force platform concentric peak force data, and bodyweights.</li>

<h3>Project 5: KinaTrax Pitching Biomechanics Data - Case Study ‚öæ</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Analyze and interpret biomechanical and ball pitching data for performance and injury preventative purposes (Averages, Launch Angles, Spin Rates, Elbow Varus Torque).</li>
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> Pitching-related elbow injuries in baseball are common and often linked to repetitive high-velocity throws, which stress structures like the ulnar collateral ligament and radiohumeral articulation. Trunk rotation during the pitching delivery can increase torques at the shoulder and elbow, but the specific energy transmission mechanisms into the medial elbow need further investigation for optimizing pitching techniques and reducing injury risks. (Aguinaldo, Buttermore, & Chambers, 2007; Oyama et al., 2014; Aguinaldo & Chambers, 2009; Werner et al., 2002).</li>

      What was the launch angle (Launch_Angle) on each hit?<br>
      What was the result of each play (Play_Result)?<br>
      Bullet-point up to 3 primary insights you can derive from this ranking.<br>

      <ul>
        <li>11 out of 15 (73%) of the hardest hit pitches were fastballs, suggesting that weaker contact could be influenced with off-speed pitches</li>
        <li>Launch angles between 10 and 26 degrees often presented desirable play results (Single/HomeRun) while launch angles greater than 30 resulted in outs</li>
        <li>If a hitter can achieve high exit velocities (>100mph), coaches might consider implementing practice drills where hitters are encouraged to attack the ball within 10 to 26 degrees of launch angle</li>

    <li>Is there a statistically significant difference in mean Elbow Varus Torque at Max Shoulder External Rotation (Elb_Var_Torque_MER) between Pitchers (id_pitcher) 800021 and 800098? (Œ± _< 0.05)<br>
      <img src="https://github.com/ktrev123/Trevor-Abshire-Portfolio/assets/138731104/444ae7f0-710f-456b-8cc5-a9af778099d9" alt="image" width="600"><br>
      <img src="https://github.com/ktrev123/Trevor-Abshire-Portfolio/assets/138731104/21cf649e-d896-421f-8d0c-2165bc202e06" alt="image" width="600"></li>  
    <li>Based on your findings from Question 4, provide further analysis on where you would recommend biomechanical intervention with either pitcher.<br>

   Pitcher21 and Pitcher98 show a statistically significant difference in elbow varus torque at maximal external rotation while having similar average fastball and breaking ball velocities (Pitcher21 = 92.02/81.04mph, Pitcher98 = 92.71/82.35mph). This suggests that further investigation into Pitcher98's biomechanical capabilities is necessary.
Considering the anatomical requirements of both the lower and upper extremities along with the trunk and pelvis during the pitching delivery at time of max external rotation, four upper extremity metrics, two lower, one thoracic, and one pelvic metric were correlated against elbow varus torque at max external rotation and pitch velocity within the entire pitching staff. One lower extremity and one thoracic variable of interest were identified to have a moderate negative correlation with elbow varus torque at max external rotation within the entire pitching staff: Trunk_Lean_MER (r = -0.47) and Lead_Ankle_EvInv_MER (r = -0.38). A statistical analysis was performed to identify if Pitcher98 had significantly different trunk lean and lead ankle positioning than the rest of the pitching staff. An independent, non-parametric, statistical test showed that Pitcher98 has statistically significant differences in both trunk lean and lead ankle positioning at max external rotation in comparison to the rest of the pitching staff.
While individual pitching mechanics are infinitely unique in nature, these findings suggest assessing the biomechanical capabilities of Pitcher98‚Äôs trunk and lead ankle. Pitcher98 would likely benefit from a complete and detailed analysis of the stability and mobility of the lead ankle joint and thoracic spine. Meanwhile, assessment of the capabilities of the external and internal rotator musculature of the shoulder as well as scapulohumeral rhythm could provide further insight to the force accepting capabilities of Pitcher98‚Äôs medial elbow. It is also advised to monitor throwing volume and intensity for Pitcher98 given that he is undergoing significantly higher medial elbow forces compared to his teammate.
