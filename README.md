# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction
- My name is Trevor Abshire, I am an ex-collegiate athlete, currently serving as Assistant Director of Sport Performance Lead Data Analyst at the University of California Davis. With a strong passion for leveraging data to drive performance and optimize training strategies, I strive to blend my background in athletics with my analytical skills to deliver impactful insights.

As an ex-collegiate athlete, I understand the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving athletic performance. My experience on the mound has ignited a keen interest in exploring the vast potential of data analytics within the sports industry. Combining my expertise in strength and conditioning with my proficiency in data analytics, I aim to optimize training protocols, identify performance patterns, and provide valuable insights to athletes and coaches to increase longevity and win championships!

Throughout my career, I have successfully applied data analytics techniques to analyze and interpret complex datasets, enabling evidence-based decision-making. I possess a strong foundation in various analytical tools and programming languages, including R, SQL, Excel/Sheets, and Tableau, allowing me to extract actionable insights from diverse datasets and communicate them effectively to stakeholders.

With a commitment to continuous learning and professional growth, I have completed certifications in data science and data visualization, further strengthening my analytical skills and expanding my knowledge in the field.

In this portfolio, I showcase my projects, skills, and achievements, demonstrating my ability to extract valuable insights from data and drive positive outcomes. I am excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and contribute to the field of data analytics in the context of sports and performance optimization.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out for potential collaboration, discussion, or networking opportunities.

## Projects

### Project 1: Force Platform Analysis for Injury Prevention
- **Objective:** Analyze force platform data collected from athletes during various movements (e.g., jumps, landings) to identify potential injury risk factors.
- **Description:** Utilized force platform data to quantify ground reaction forces, loading rates, and other relevant metrics. Conducted statistical analysis to identify correlations between force variables and injury occurrence. Developed actionable recommendations for modifying training protocols and technique to minimize injury risks.

### Project 2: Performance Analysis using GPS Data
- **Objective:** Explore the relationship between performance metrics and GPS data collected during training sessions and games.
- **Description:** Integrated GPS data, including speed, distance, and acceleration, with performance metrics such as running times, player workload, and game statistics. Employed data visualization techniques to identify patterns, trends, and performance benchmarks. Provided insights to coaches and athletes to optimize training strategies, improve performance, and make data-informed decisions.

### Project 3: Velocity-Based Training (VBT) Optimization
- **Objective:** Optimize training programs using VBT data to enhance strength and power development.
- **Description:** Analyzed VBT data capturing barbell velocity and power output during strength training exercises. Developed algorithms to assess individual strength profiles, determine optimal loading parameters, and predict performance outcomes. Created visualizations and dashboards to monitor and guide training progress, aiding coaches in adjusting loads and intensities based on real-time velocity feedback.

### Project 4: Combine Data Analysis for Talent Evaluation
- **Objective:** Analyze combine data to assess athletic potential and identify key performance indicators for player evaluation.
- **Description:** Examined combine data encompassing various physical tests, such as sprint times, vertical jump heights, and agility drills. Conducted statistical analyses and developed composite scoring models to assess athletic performance. Identified performance benchmarks for specific positions and provided insights to scouts and coaches for talent evaluation and player selection.
